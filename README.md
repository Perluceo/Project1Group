<h1>What's Your Vibe</h1>

What's your vibe is an application to help people find entertainment based on their current mood and pairs the findings with Instagram hashtags.  This group collaboration picked 6 moods but was tailored to 3 moods for presenting the minimal working application.  In future developments all 6 moods would be included with a coded google api for automatic clickable venue content.  As a future development with initial investment would include specific instagram feeds for each venue.  As this application was not monetized the paid instagram subscription was not attained.


<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
1.  Google Places API
2.  Google Maps API
3.  Instagram API
4.  Bootstrap
5.  Ajax

<h3>Further Notes</h3>
To run the application both an api key and instagram token are required and are not included in the repository for security issues.
