# Project1Group

What's your vibe is an application to help people find entertainment based on their current mood.  This group collaboration picked 6 moods but was tailored to 3 moods for presenting the minimal working application.  In future developments all 6 moods would be included with a coded google api for automatic clickable venue content.
